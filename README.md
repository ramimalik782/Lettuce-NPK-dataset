**CONTEXT**

This dataset contains images of the following lettuce deficiency category together with Fully Nutritional hydroponic lettuce:  

Fully Nutritional,  Nitrogen Deficient,  Phosphorus Deficient,  Potassium Deficient

**CONTENT**

This dataset contains four folders:

FN (12 images)

-N (58 images each)

-P (66 images each)

-K (72 images each)


each of the folders above contains images for deficiency of lettuce

**DATA COLLECTION**

The images in this dataset were done on a hydroponic environment for a project on lettuce deficiencies specifically NPK.

**INSPIRATION**

The idea was to build a system which recognizes the lettuce deficiencies from the captured photo and gives its user the classification of the deficiency of the lettuce. I aim to help other people with this data that I have made available in the internet.
